         <li><u><h2>Naming</h2></u></li>
         <p>The catacombs were named Kom El Shoqafa, meaning Mound of Shards, because the area used to contain a mound of shards of terra cotta
             which mostly consisted of jars and objects made of clay. These objects were left by those visiting the tombs,
              who would bring food and wine for their consumption during the visit. However, they did not wish to carry these containers home
               from this place of death, so they would break them.
             At the time of the discovery, heaps of these broken plates were found</p>
         <li><u><h2>Layout</h2></u></li>
         <p>
            The catacombs lie beneath the western necropolis of Alexandria and consist of three levels cut through solid rock,
             the third level was completely underwater until recent restorations.
             The catacombs have a six-pillared central shaft which opens off the vestibule. On the left is a triclinium,
              a funeral banquet hall where friends and family gathered on stone couches covered with cushions,
             both at the time of burial and also on future commemorative visits.

    <p>The necropolis consists of a series of Alexandrian tombs, statues and archaeological objects of the Pharaonic funerary cult with Hellenistic and early Imperial Roman influences. Due to the time period, many of the features of the catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa merge Roman, Greek and Egyptian cultural points; some statues are Egyptian in style, yet bear Roman clothes and hair style whilst other features share a similar style. A circular staircase, which was often used to transport deceased bodies down the middle of it, leads down into the tombs that were tunneled into the bedrock during the age of the Antonine emperors (2nd century CE).[3] The facility was then used as a burial chamber from the 2nd century to the 4th century, before being rediscovered in 1900 when a donkey accidentally fell into the access shaft. To date, three sarcophagi have been found, along with other human and animal remains which were added later. It is believed that the catacombs were only intended for a single family, but it is unclear why the site was expanded in order to house numerous other individuals.

        Another feature of the catacombs is the Hall of Caracalla, which contains the bones of horses which were the tombs created for the horses of the emperor Caracalla in 215 CE.</p>
